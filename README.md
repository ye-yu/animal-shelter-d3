## Visualization Info

Not many of the people around the globe are aware of the life of domesticated animals. Often enough, they will only get to see these animals when they are approached through media such as documentary or when they are considering for adoption. On the other hand, those who manage these animals on a daily basis such as a shelter organization do not have the right tools to communicate this data to the public. Hence, they made it available for the public to explore their own findings. Being recorded directly from this organization, this data set can help us to summarize the types of journeys that these animals went through over their lifetime.
