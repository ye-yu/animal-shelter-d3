## For Contributors

### 1. Branching repository

Contributors must perform their development on their own  development branch. Before merging branch with the master branch, contributors must make sure their branch does not produce any bugs or conflicts with another branch.

### 2. Milestones

Contributors can review the project milestones [in this page](https://github.com/ye-yu/animal-shelter-d3/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).

### 3. Developing tools

Atom IDE enables package installation that can assist the development such as the package `atom-live-server` that auto-reloads page when a change of file content is made.

### 4. Other notes

All pages must reference link in root-relative level. For example, on the project directory level, if the target file is in the folder `js`, then the anchor tag must be written as follows:

```html
<a href="/js/<filename>"> Link </a>
```
